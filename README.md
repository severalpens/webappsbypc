# Web Apps by PC
Demo apps by Paul Collins, Ballarat, Victoria

## Setup 
The app uses AWS Amplify for PaaS hosting. Refer to 
[docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)
and 
[docs](https://docs.amplify.aws/nextjs/) for local environment setup

Once set up, clone the repo and run the following:

- ` npm i `
- ` npx ampx sandbox --profile default `

Then run the following in a separate terminal:
- ` npm run dev `
